# HeartDisease_Prediction
Predicting whether the patients have heart disease or not based on the factors like age, cholestrol, sex etc.


### Problem Statement
Letâ€™s consider the heart disease data set that we discussed in the earlier segment. The data lists various tests that were conducted on patients along with some other details of the patients. Now, given the test results and other attributes, suppose you want to predict whether a person has a heart disease or not.

Please note that:

Heart disease = 0 means that the person does not have heart disease.
Heart disease = 1 means that the person has heart disease.

 

sex = 0 means that the person is female.
sex = 1 means that the person is male.

Predictions must be done based on the different medical factors .
